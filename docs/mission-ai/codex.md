# Mission AI with Codex CLI

Use this guide only if you are authorized to use NASA Mission AI. This configures the Mission AI LiteLLM gateway, not NASA Chat.

**Compatibility note:** The [Mission AI VS Code template](../../templates/mission-ai/chatLanguageModels.json.example) documents `/v1/chat/completions`. Codex requires `/v1/responses` with streaming and tool calls. This deployment's Responses compatibility has not yet been validated; use the setup below as a local trial, and contact the service owner if the gateway does not support it.

## Install

Install the Codex CLI using the current [Codex installation guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/), then check it is available:

```bash
codex --version
```

## Configure

1. Merge the [Mission AI Codex provider template](../../templates/mission-ai/codex.config.toml.example) into **your user-level** `~/.codex/config.toml`. Keep existing settings and other provider definitions. Do not put this provider in a repository's `.codex/config.toml`: Codex ignores project-level provider and authentication settings.
2. Make `NASA_MISSION_AI_API_KEY` available through an approved credential mechanism in the environment where you launch Codex. Codex reads it as a bearer token via `env_key`; the template contains no key itself. Do not place a literal key in the TOML or commit one. A variable set in one terminal may not be available to a separately launched GUI client.
3. Start a new session with the provider and an approved Mission AI OpenAI model (for example, `gpt-5.6-luna`):

   ```bash
   codex -c 'model_provider="nasa_mission_ai"' -m gpt-5.6-luna
   ```

The template does not change your default provider or model. Plain `codex` continues to use your existing defaults. In the session, `/status` shows the active model, but the model name alone does not identify the provider: the launch-time `model_provider` override selects Mission AI. `/model` changes the model, not the provider; start a new session to switch providers.

If you receive a 401, confirm that the key in the **launching terminal** is a valid Mission AI LiteLLM key. A successful key check does not prove Responses compatibility. If authentication succeeds but streaming or tool calls fail, ask the service owner whether this deployment supports Codex's `/v1/responses` interface. Share errors only after redacting any keys or tokens.
